\subsection{Why is the model appropriate for the problem?}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{\subsecname}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The model is appropriate for the problem since the data set is not particularly huge and the problem pretty much begs for a model solution with better accuracy.
		\item Although sacrificing processing speed, the use of MLP for this problem helps yield better results even though the data set used is not particularly huge as compared to the ones used for deep learning.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accuracy is more important than speed since we aim to predict student employability based on the given traits a student has as accurate as possible.
