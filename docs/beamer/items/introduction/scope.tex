	\begin{itemize}
		\item This project seeks to predict whether a Filipino student is employable based on their assessed traits.
		\item However, this does NOT mean that the algorithm judges whether the student is employable or less employable (i.e., prone to rejections in job applications) when a student finally tries to apply for a job.
		\item The project only aims to seek the weak points a student has so that the student has a chance to improve on it after evaluation.
		\item Hence, it is still upon the student's overall performance whether or not that student gets accepted in the applied job position, which is out of the project's scope.
