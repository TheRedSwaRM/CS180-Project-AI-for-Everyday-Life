	\begin{itemize}
		\item This project seeks to predict whether a Filipino student is employable based on their assessed traits.
		\item This means that the algorithm ``judges'' whether the student is employable or less employable (i.e., prone to rejections in job applications) given the student's traits.
		\item However, this does not mean the algorithm serves as the hiring manager that outrightly accepts or rejects that student on the spot.
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item In this case, the project only aims to assess the student's traits and reveals the weak points that the student has so that the student has a chance to improve on it after evaluation.
		\item Hence, it is still upon the student's overall performance in the job application process whether or not that student gets accepted in the applied job position, which is out of the project's scope.
