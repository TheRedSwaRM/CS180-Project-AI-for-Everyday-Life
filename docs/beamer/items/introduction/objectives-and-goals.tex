	\begin{itemize}
		\item The group aims to develop and train the multilayer perceptron algorithm in order to achieve the following goals:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Uncover meaningful patterns and insights with regards to students' employability.
				\item Predict student employability based on the given traits a student has.
				\item Develop a user-friendly web application that intuitively applies the algorithm into general use.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item To accomplish the project goals stated above, the group has to satisfy the project's key objectives as follows:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Preprocess the acquired ``Students' Employability Dataset - Philippines'' dataset for the model to use.
				\item Train the Multilayer Perceptron model and rigorously evaluate their performance and generalization capabilities.
				\item Apply the trained models for predictive analytics, enabling sufficiently accurate predictions, and actionable recommendations.
				\item Deploy a web application that future employees can use to identify whether they can be employed based on the following features defined in the model.
			\end{itemize}
