	\begin{itemize}
		\item We conclude in this project that using Multilayer Perceptrons as machine learning algorithm is not necessarily a bad idea even though it sacrifices performance for sake of accuracy.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item After all, there are use cases wherein a problem demands for a solution with better accuracy than a faster one.
		\end{itemize}
		\item We also conclude that we can find ways on solving interesting problems using machine learning. We can even use it to check if we are even fit to get employed in a job! 
		\item We realized that machine learning can still do so many ways despite it being on top of artificial intelligence.
