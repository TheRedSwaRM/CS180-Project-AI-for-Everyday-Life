	\begin{itemize}
		\item We realize the power of Multilayer Perceptrons in solving classification problems in terms of accuracy.
		\item We realize that there can also be so many ways of solving a particular problem, may it be a mathematical solution or a machine learning algorithm.
		\item Upon this, with so many methods already given to us, there is always a chance we can use such methods to solve more problems in the future.
