	\begin{itemize}
		\item We are actually limited to the provided dataset in Kaggle. It would be much nicer if we can obtain larger datasets containing these kinds of evaluations from different companies in the Philippines.
		\item More features would be nice for a much accurate assessment of the student with regards to employability.
		\item If we, by chance, obtain a much larger dataset regarding employability, the use of deep learning might be an option. We may even work with other types of inputs such as a video sample of student speaking so that we may implement a sort of AI-based interviewer to evaluate if the student is \texttt{Employable} or \texttt{LessEmployable} in the future.
