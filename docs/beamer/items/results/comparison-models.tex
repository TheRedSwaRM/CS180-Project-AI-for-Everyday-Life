	\begin{itemize}
		\item The model is appropriate for the problem since the data set is not particularly huge and the problem pretty much begs for a model solution with better accuracy.
		\item Although sacrificing processing speed, the use of MLP for this problem helps yield better results even though the data set used is not particularly huge as compared to the ones used for deep learning.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Accuracy is more important than speed since we aim to predict student employability based on the given traits a student has as accurate as possible.

	\item Upon comparing the accuracy of the MLP model among different models utilized by a similar research shown above, it can be said that the MLP model is among the top performers when it comes to predicting student employability.

	\item It has a better accuracy score compared to logistic regression and SVM (linear), and is slightly better than SVM-RBF. Our model's accuracy is only beaten by the KNN model by a small margin.
